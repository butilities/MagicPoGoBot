## This repository is a fork updated of [NecroBot] (https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot).

##This fork was made because there are many forks going around made by non developers and people without github experience and they are dying within the day. They are also not addressing issues or request, here what we are trying to do is keep the ball rolling and add features more frequently
